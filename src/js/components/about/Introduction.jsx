                        Beta.USAspending.gov is the new official source of accessible, searchable
                        and reliable spending data for the U.S. Government.

                    <p>
                        Treasury released this new version of the USAspending.gov site in accordance
                        with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) requirements.
                        The &#8220;Beta&#8221; site will run concurrently with the previous version
                        of the USAspending.gov website over the summer to minimize disruptions to
                        users&#39; data access and provide more time to add user-centered
                        enhancements. The new Beta.USAspending.gov site tracks agency expenditures
                        and for the first time, links relevant agency expenditure data with awards
                        distributed by the government.
